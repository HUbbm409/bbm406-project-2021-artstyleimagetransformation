# BBM406 Project - Art Style Image Transformation
Developed by Oktay Uğurlu, Koray Kara, Ahmet Deniz Güner.

# How to Run

Firstly, you have to run main.py file to cluster the dataset. After, you can run style_based_cyclegan_vgg19.py file to train CycleGAN model over the clustered dataset. Also, you can reach the FID evaluation metric implementation from here fretched_instance_distance.py 

# Dataset
